- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jamziewebdev
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development and graphic design.
- 🌱 I have recently finished courses in HTML, CSS, C# and SQL, and am just about to start learning more JavaScript.
- 📫 How to reach me; Here or on email - info@jamziewebdev.net
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had no clue about programming and web dev 1.5 years ago, now I can do 12 hours straight because I just love it so much.
- 🔎 If you want to see more of my work, my website www.jamziewebdev.net, is currently live
- with some content that I created in my recent HTML and CSS course, as well as some
- old websites.
