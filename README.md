- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jamziewebdev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in fullstack development and graphic design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and will soon start furthering my knowledge
- in C#, SQL, before moving on to some more JavaScript.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me; Here or on email - info@jamziewebdev.net
- âš¡ Fun fact: I had no clue about programming and web dev 1.5 years ago, now I can do 12 hours straight because I just love it so much.
- ðŸ”Ž If you want to see more of my work, my website www.jamziewebdev.net, is currently live
- with some content that I created in my current HTML and CSS course, as well as some
- old websites.
