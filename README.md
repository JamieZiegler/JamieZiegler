- ðŸ“« How to reach me; Here or on email - info@jamziewebdev.net
- âš¡ Fun fact: I had no clue about programming and web dev 1.5 years ago, now I can do 12 hours straight because I just love it so much.
- ðŸ”Ž If you want to see more of my work, my website www.jamziewebdev.net is usually a good place for it, although it is currently not displaying much more than a short message.
