- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jamziewebdev
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development and graphic design.
- 🌱 I have recently finished courses in HTML, CSS, C#, JavaScript and SQL. Currently I'm doing my first internship at Vertel AB.
- 📫 How to reach me; Here or on email - info@jamziewebdev.net
- ⚡ Fun fact: I had no clue about programming and web dev 1.5 years ago, now I can do 12 hours straight because I just love it so much.
- 🔎 If you want to see more of my work, my website www.jamziewebdev.net is usually a good place for it.
